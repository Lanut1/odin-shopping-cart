# MR. BUTCHER Shopping Cart

## Overview
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, designed to enhance hands-on experience with front-end technologies. **MR. BUTCHER Shopping Cart** is an e-commerce application focused on shopping cart functionality, built using modern web development tools and libraries.

## Technologies Used
- **React** with **Vite**: Provides a fast, modular front-end structure and development environment.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **React Router**: Manages application routing for navigating between different pages.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Handles state management, particularly for cart operations and product handling.
- **Material UI (MUI)**: Offers a robust component library with customizable theming for consistent, responsive styling.

## Features
- **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Allows users to add, update, and remove items from the cart.
- **Dynamic Product List**: Displays a variety of butcher shop items with their images, prices, and details.
- **Persistent Cart State**: Ensures cart contents remain consistent across page reloads.
- **Theming with MUI**: Provides custom colors and design for a unique, branded user experience.
- **Responsive Layout**: Implemented a simple responsive design for a smooth experience on various screen sizes. The design can be further refined and developed in the future for more enhanced responsiveness.
- **Mock API for Image Display**: Since a suitable API was unavailable, images were sourced from **Pixabay** and **Unsplash**. A custom mock API and fetch function were created to display the necessary images dynamically.
